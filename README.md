Project: Microsoft Store Scraper and Data Analysis

This project involves web scraping the Microsoft Store to gather detailed information about applications, including categories, ratings, reviews, and prices. The scraped data is then processed and analyzed using various Python libraries to gain insights into app trends, customer feedback, and pricing structures.

Features:
Web Scraping:

The project uses BeautifulSoup and requests to scrape data from the Microsoft Store.
It extracts app metadata such as name, category, ratings, number of reviews, price, and developer information.
Data Cleaning:

The raw data is cleaned using pandas to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats for consistent analysis.
Data Analysis:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Using matplotlib and seaborn, visualizations are created to analyze app distribution across categories, the correlation between price and ratings, and the sentiment from user reviews.
Statistical Analysis:
scipy is used for performing statistical tests to explore patterns in app ratings, and numpy helps with data manipulation.
Sentiment Analysis:
Text mining of user reviews is performed using NLTK to gauge overall customer sentiment for the most popular applications.
Data Visualization:

Interactive plots created using Plotly to visualize trends in app ratings, pricing, and review counts over time.
A dashboard summarizing key findings is created with Dash to provide a user-friendly interface for non-technical users to explore the data.
Deployment:

The final project includes Jupyter Notebooks with detailed comments and visualizations to make it easy for others to reproduce the analysis.
All relevant code is hosted in a GitHub repository for version control and collaboration.
Technologies Used:
Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup, requests
Data Analysis: pandas, numpy, scipy
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, Dash
Text Mining & NLP: NLTK
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Purpose:
The project provides valuable insights into the app ecosystem on the Microsoft Store, helping developers and marketers understand pricing trends, user preferences, and review sentiments. It can also assist in identifying popular categories and feature gaps within the storeâ€™s offerings.
